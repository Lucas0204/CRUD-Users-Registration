## API REST - Users Registration - NodeJs | Express | MySQL | Sequelize

### It is a REST API for registering users on a system.

### - About

- This project was done with the backend in NodeJs and Express for the server. The database I used to register was MySQL and also Sequelize as ORM.

- To handle the registrations and the manipulation of the database, I created the services folder that contains the files responsible for this. The controllers folder is only responsible for handling the request and sending it to services.

- For this project, I also used migrations, which do a versioning of the database, which makes it easier in case of errors.

- All tests were done through Insomnia, which makes requests for all methods.
